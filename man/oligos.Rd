\section{Design strategy for primers}{


Primers can be generated by using one of the two following strategies:

\itemize{
\item{The \strong{ambiguous strategy} (default) generates primers from the
IUPAC consensus sequence, which means that ambiguous bases can
occur at any position in the primer.}

\item{The \strong{mixed strategy} generates primers from both the majority
and the IUPAC consensus sequence. These primers consist of a shorter
degenerate part at the 3' end (approx. 1/3 of the primer, targeting a
conserved
region) and a longer consensus part at the 5' end (approx.
2/3 of the primer),
which instead of having ambiguous bases contains the most probable
nucleotide at each position.
This strategy is based on the Consensus-Degenerate Hybrid
Oligonucleotide Primer (CODEHOP) principle (Rose et al., 1998), and aims to
to allow amplification of highly variable targets with minimal degeneracy.
The idea is that the degenerate 3' end part will bind specifically to
the target sequence in the initial PCR cycles, and promote amplification
in spite of eventual mismatches at the 5' consensus part
(since 5' end mismatches are generally less detrimental than
3' end mismatches). In this way, the generated products
will match the 5' ends of all primers perfectly, which allows them
to be efficiently amplified in later PCR cycles.
To provide a sufficiently high tm in spite of mismatches, it is
recommended to design relatively long primers (at least 25 bases) when using
this strategy}
}

Probes are always designed using the ambiguous
strategy.
}

\section{Validity checks}{


For an oligo to be considered as valid, all sequence variants must fulfill
all the specified design constraints.

Oligos with sequence variants containing
more than four consecutive runs
of the same
nucleotide (e.g. "AAAAA") and/or more than three consecutive runs
of the same di-nucleotide (e.g. "TATATATA") are excluded from consideration.
}

\section{Tm}{


Melting temperatures
are calculated for perfectly matching
DNA duplexes using the
nearest-neighbor
method (SantaLucia and Hicks, 2004), by using the following equation:

\deqn{Tm = (\Delta H ^o \cdot 1000) / (\Delta S ^o + R \cdot \log [\mathrm{oligo}]) - 273.15}

where \eqn{\Delta H ^o} is
the change in enthalpy (in cal/mol) and \eqn{\Delta S ^o} is the
change in entropy (in cal/K/mol) when an
oligo and a perfectly matching target sequence goes from random coil to
duplex formation.
\eqn{K} is the gas constant (1.9872 cal/mol \emph{K}).

The following salt correction method is used for \eqn{\Delta S^o}, as
described in SantaLucia and Hicks (2004):

\deqn{\Delta S^o [\mathrm{Na^+}] = \Delta S^o [\mathrm{1 M NaCl}] + 0.368 \cdot N / 2 \cdot \log [\mathrm{Na^+}]}

where \eqn{N} is the total number of phosphates in the duplex, and [Na+] is the total
concentration of monovalent cations.

Nearest neighbor table values for \eqn{\Delta S^o} and \eqn{\Delta H^o} are from SantaLucia and Hicks, 2004, and can be
retrieved calling \code{rprimer:::lookup$nn}.
}

\section{Score}{


All valid oligos are scored based on their identity, coverage,
degeneracy,
average GC content and tm range. The scoring system is presented below.

\strong{Identity and coverage}

\tabular{lr}{
Value range \tab Score \cr
\eqn{(0.99, 1]} \tab 0 \cr
\eqn{(0.95, 0.99]} \tab 1 \cr
\eqn{(0.90, 0.95]} \tab 2 \cr
\eqn{\leq 0.90} \tab 3
}

\strong{Degeneracy}

\tabular{lr}{
Value \tab Score \cr
1 \tab 0 \cr
2 or 3 \tab 1 \cr
3 or 4 \tab 2 \cr
More than 4 \tab 3
}

\strong{Average GC-content}

This score is based on how much
the average GC-content deviates from 0.5 (in absolute value).

\tabular{lr}{
Value range \tab Score \cr
\eqn{[0, 0.05)}
\tab 0 \cr
\eqn{[0.05, 0.1)}
\tab 1 \cr
\eqn{[0.1,  0.2)}
\tab 2 \cr
\eqn{\geq 0.2} \tab 3
}

\strong{Tm range}

\tabular{lr}{
Value range \tab Score \cr
\eqn{[0, 1)}
\tab 0 \cr
\eqn{[1, 2)}
\tab 1 \cr
\eqn{[2, 3)}
\tab 2 \cr
\eqn{\geq 3} \tab 3
}

These scores are summarized to a total score, and
the weight of each individual score is 1. Thus, the lowest and best
possible score for an oligo is 0, and the worst possible score is 12.
