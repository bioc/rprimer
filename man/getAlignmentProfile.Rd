\title{Get the sequence profile of an alignment}
\usage{
getAlignmentProfile(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An alignment of DNA sequences.}
}
\value{
The sequence profile (an object of class RprimerProfile).
A numeric m x n matrix,
where m is the number of unique bases in the alignment, and n is the
number of positions in the alignment.
}
\description{
\code{getAlignmentProfile} returns a matrix with the
proportion of each nucleotide at each position within an alignment
of DNA sequences.The function is a wrapper around
Biostrings::consensusMatrix.
