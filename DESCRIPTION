Title: Design Degenerate Oligos from a Multiple DNA Sequence Alignment
Version: 0.99.0
Description: 
    Functions, workflow and a Shiny application for visualizing sequence 
    conservation and designing degenerate primers, probes and (RT)-(q/d)PCR 
    assays from a multiple DNA sequence alignment. The results can be presented 
    in data frame format and visualized as dashboard like plots. The workflow is 
    developed primarily for sequence variable RNA viruses, but it should also
    be useful for other targets with high sequence variability.
    For more information, please see the package vignette.
