Title: Design (RT)-(q/d)PCR Assays from Multiple DNA Sequence Alignments
Version: 0.99.0
Description: Functions and workflow to design
    primers, probes and (RT)-(q/d)PCR assays from multiple DNA sequence 
    alignments. The functions are especially designed 
    for sequence variable targets, such as RNA viruses. 
    Primers, probes and assays are designed from
    user specified constraints on e.g. oligo and amplicon length, 
    GC-content, melting temperature and maximum allowed number degenerate 
    variants. For more information about rprimer and its 
    functionality, please see the package vignette.
