Title: Design (RT)-(q/d)PCR Assays from a Multiple DNA Sequence Alignment
Version: 0.99.0
Description: Functions and workflow for visualizing sequence conservation 
    and designing
    degenerate primers, probes and (RT)-(q/d)PCR assays from a 
    multiple DNA sequence alignment. The workflow is especially developed for
    sequence variable viruses.
