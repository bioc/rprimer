Title: Design Degenerate Oligos from a Multiple DNA Sequence Alignment
Version: 0.99.0
Description: 
    Functions and workflow for visualizing sequence conservation 
    and designing degenerate primers, probes and (RT)-(q/d)PCR assays from a 
    multiple DNA sequence alignment. The results can be presented in data-frame 
    format and visualized as dashboard-like plots. 
    The package is developed primarily for sequence variable viruses, 
    but it should be equally useful for other organisms with high sequence 
    variability. For more information, please see the package vignette.
