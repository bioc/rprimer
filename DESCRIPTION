Title: Design (RT)-(q/d)PCR Assays from a Multiple DNA Sequence Alignment
Version: 0.99.0
Description: Functions and workflow to design
    primers, probes and (RT)-(q/d)PCR assays from a multiple DNA sequence 
    alignment. The design process is especially developed
    for sequence variable targets, such as RNA viruses. 
    Please see the package vignette for more information.
